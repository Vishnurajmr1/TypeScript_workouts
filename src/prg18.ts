/*Grades are computed using a weighted average. 
Suppose that the written test counts 70%,  
lab exams 20% and assignments 10%.
If Arun has a score of
Written test = 81
Lab exams = 68
Assignments = 92
Arunâ€™s overall grade = (81x70)/100 + (68x20)/100 + (92x10)/100 = 79.5
 Write a program to find the grade of a student during his academic year. 
Program should accept the scores for written test, lab exams and assignments
Output the grade of a student (using weighted average)
